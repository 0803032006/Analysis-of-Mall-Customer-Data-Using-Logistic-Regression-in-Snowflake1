# Mall Customer Analysis Using Logistic Regression in Snowflake

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing mall customer data and classifying customers based on their spending behavior using Logistic Regression. The model is implemented using Snowflake SQL and Python (Google Colab) for data analysis and visualization.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze mall customer demographic and spending data
- To classify customers as High Spenders or Low Spenders
- To apply Logistic Regression for customer behavior prediction
- To understand SQL-based machine learning using Snowflake

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following attributes:
- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Customer Class (Target Variable)

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- Logistic Regression (Classification Algorithm)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Snowflake (SQL & ML)
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## ⚙️ Methodology
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Gender column encoding
3. Feature selection
4. Logistic Regression model creation
5. Model training and prediction
6. Result analysis and visualization

---

## 📈 Output
- Predicts whether a customer is a High Spender or Low Spender
- Helps in customer segmentation and targeted marketing

---

## ✅ Conclusion
Logistic Regression effectively classifies mall customers based on spending patterns. Snowflake provides a scalable and efficient platform to perform machine learning using SQL, making customer analysis faster and more reliable.
